Sure, here's an example of a README file that explains the code we've worked on:

# MERN Stack Web Template

This is a web template built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes a grid with provisions for a live instructional video, space to show a live video of the student listening to it, and their emotional status. It also includes a simple form that is connected to a backend database.

## Getting Started

To run this template, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- MongoDB

Once you have those installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. In a separate terminal window, start MongoDB by running the command `mongod`.
5. Back in the first terminal window, start the server by running the command `npm start`.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the template in action.

## Components

### Grid Container

The `grid-container` class sets up a CSS grid with two columns and two rows, with a gap of 20 pixels between grid items.

### Live Instructional Video

The `live-video` class sets up a video player with a width of 100% and a height of 400 pixels. This is where the instructional video will be displayed.

### Live Video of the Student Listening

The `live-video-student` class sets up a video player with a width of 100% and a height of 400 pixels. This is where the live video of the student listening will be displayed.

### Emotional Status

The `emotional-status` class sets up a container for displaying the student's emotional status. It has a height of 200 pixels and a width of 100%, and includes a centered heading that displays the student's emotional status.

### Form

The `form-container` class sets up a container for the form. It includes a label, input field, and submit button. When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the backend database.

## Backend

The backend code is written using Node.js and Express, and connects to a MongoDB database. The `server.js` file sets up the Express app and connects to the database. The `routes/api.js` file contains the API routes for handling form submissions and retrieving data from the database.

## Frontend

The frontend code is written using React. The `App.js` file contains the main React component that renders the web template. The `components` directory contains the individual components used in the template.

## Conclusion

This MERN stack web template provides a basic starting point for building web applications that require video playback, database integration, and form submission. Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs.
